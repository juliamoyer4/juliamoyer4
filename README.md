# Julia Moyer's Portfolio

**Hello!** My name is Julia Moyer and I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am studying Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies and Information Science. I am interested in the intersection of design, technology, and consumers.

## Projects
-[Campus Study Spots Website](https://juliamoyer4.github.io/index.html): Utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing, responsive,  and intuitive website describing the best places to study on UW-Madison campus with five interlinked pages. Applied CSS styling to present images and text in a visually appealing and readable layout. Prioritized accessibility by evaluating the website through Wave by Webaim ensuring that all images had alternate text and confirmed overall site accessibility.
-["Dear Data" Project](): Gathered data daily for two weeks about personal music consumption while storing data in an organized manner. Created a hand drawn unique visualization inspired by the book “Dear Data”. Loaded and visualized data in R to develop clear insights and effectively communicate the results.
